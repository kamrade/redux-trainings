1. Working with redux is the same as you working with normal js object, but with using dispatchers. Every dispatcher should consist of property name and certain value.

2. Pure function. Giving same input we always gona get same output. It don't relay with variables outside function.
    There is 3 principes:
    1. Same output with the same input
    2. No side effects. Can't take vars from the global state. Shouldn't update any variables outside of it.
    3. Avoid promices and asyncronise code. Function should be syncronise.
